# Project Name

## Overview

This project serves as a robust template for building scalable, efficient, and secure web applications. Initially designed to be reusable and adaptable, it lays the foundation for a backend system built with scalability, security, and efficiency in mind. The frontend, while primarily for testing and demonstration purposes at this stage, is crafted to complement the backend's capabilities, ensuring fast load times and scalability.

The backend is developed using Go 1.22, taking advantage of its latest features and improvements for optimal performance and developer experience. The frontend is built with Next.js 14.1.0, utilizing TypeScript to enhance code quality and reliability.

## Features

- **Backend**
  
  - Built with the latest version of Go (1.22), focusing on security, efficiency, and scalability.
  -Implements best practices for structuring a Go web application, including proper package organization, middleware integration, and database management.
  -Features a comprehensive suite of middleware for logging, CORS handling, and more, ensuring a solid foundation for building complex applications.

- **Frontend**
  
  -Developed with Next.js 14.1.0 and TypeScript, emphasizing performance and scalability.
  -Lightweight and efficient, designed for quick loading times and adaptability to various use cases.
  -Includes examples of integrating with the backend, demonstrating data fetching, state management, and UI rendering.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.22
- Node.js and npm (or yarn)
  
### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```shell
   git clone https://yourrepository.git
   cd your_project
```
2. **Set up the backend**

Navigate to the backend directory and install Go dependencies.
```shell
cd backend
go mod tidy
```

Start the backend server.
```shell
Copy code
go run cmd/server/main.go
```

3. **Set up the frontend**

Navigate to the frontend directory and install Node.js dependencies.
```shell
cd frontend
npm install
```

or if you're using yarn,
```shell
yarn install
```

4. **Start the Next.js development server.**

```shell
npm run dev
```

or with yarn,
```shell
yarn dev
```

## Roadmap
-  Expand the backend to include more RESTful endpoints, authentication, cache management, queued request, goroutines, benchmark tools and more..
-  Enhance frontend interactivity, including form handling, user authentication, and dynamic data visualization.
-  Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
-  Explore containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes for improved deployment strategies.
